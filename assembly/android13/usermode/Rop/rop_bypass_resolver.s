/*
 * rop_bypass_resolver.s - ROP Bypass Resolver
 *
 * This module demonstrates bypassing NX by changing memory protection on an allocated region.
 * It allocates memory with non‚Äêexecutable protection, calls mprotect to set it executable, then
 * transfers control to a payload that writes "Bypass Resolver executed!\n".
