/*
 * inline_micro_rsa_decryptor.s - Inline RSA Decryptor Payload.
 *
 * This payload simulates RSA decryption by performing a rudimentary modular exponentiation.
 * For demonstration, it does not implement full RSA math but instead prints a message
 * indicating RSA decryption was "performed" successfully.
 *
 * In a full implementation, you would compute: decrypted = (encrypted_value ^ rsa_exponent) mod rsa_modulus.
