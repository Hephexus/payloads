/*
 * mitigation_reversal_module.s - Mitigation Reversal Module
 *
 * This module executes a series of real operations (memory allocation, mprotect calls, register reads)
 * to reverse or bypass multiple security mitigations: ASLR, NX/DEP, CFI, SELinux, etc.
 *
 * For demonstration, after executing those operations it writes a final message.
